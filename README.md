#### Welcome to my new and improved theme network and I hope you enjoy

I have finally finished creating my newest themes and I would like to thank everyone that are fans of my themes for your patience when I was taking a long vacation from creating themes after a **conflict** happened a few months ago. So here is some new information and a new invite 

So the rules are:
1. Make sure that if something is weird about my theme(aka an area is gray instead of transparent or if it's gray and it's suppose to have a color) then contact me 
2. Don't wait until the last minute when everything is greyed out because I'll just make a new one instead
3. If you have suggestions to the future theme designs like animate a certain button or add animation to the memberlist, put it in **#theme-design-suggestions-here**
4. No cursing in my server
5. No gore or any other inappropriate pictures in the server
6. No racism in the server we are a peaceful server and it should say like that
7. Don't mass spam me or my mods(coming soon) you will be banned on the spot(unless it's an emergency) 
8. No fighting in the server if you need to fight do it in DMs 

My currently invite to my newest discord server:
 
[Shadow's Safe Theme Collection](https://discord.gg/6gseVdez6A "Shadow's Discord")
